COVER_LETTER = "<p>I wish to apply for the position of %%@jobvert.position%% as advertised on the %%@jobvert.website%% website, %%@jobvert.found_on%%. I believe I have the technical experience, entrepreneurial drive and the geek-magician skills to work in a fast-paced environment leveraging the latest technologies. Furthermore, all of my coding experience has dealt only with OO scripting languages.</p><p>With nine years of experience within the software industry, I started my own consulting firm in 2009 to earn enough money to get through my final year of uni while also saving for my wedding. During this time I managed customer acquisitions, assisted my clients with analysing their business problems and then implementing a full-stack solution for them. It got so tough at times while juggling all of my clients, doing full-time uni and trying to keep my fiance happy that I had to farm the work out to half a dozen contractors displaced around the world to code my specs for my larger project.</p><p>My most recent hobby project involved promising my wife an iPad2 if she let me spend one week (on the condition it was only at nights and infront of House re-runs on the Universal channel) to hack together a web app (mymeetinghub.com) for the OpenTok dev competition that required the integration of their new video streaming API (first time I had touched the API). My wife reluctantly agreed and I successfully won her an iPad2. This lead to an invitation to further enhance the web app for the grand finalist prize of TokBox promoting the winning application to their subscribers. So I put another week (nights only) into it and won that too (<a href='http://bit.ly/hFilDr'>http://bit.ly/hFilDr</a>).</p><p>I urge you to continue reviewing the following pages of my CV to see what I can offer %%@jobvert.company%% for the position of %%@jobvert.position%%. I thank you for your time and consideration and I look forward to hearing from you soon to discuss your needs and how I may contribute to the fulfilment of %%@jobvert.company%%'s objectives.</p><h1>USA Work Eligibility</h1><p>Please do not hold it against me that I am an Australian citizen! I am currently on my honeymoon and plan to finish it in London in mid-May where I will be able to apply for the the E-3 Work Visa from the US Consulate. What does this mean? Well, I can fly to San Fran for an interview and if you like me (read as 'hire me') than I would have to fly somewhere else (exit America) to apply for the E-3 working Visa. One minor problem with this plan would be leaving my new wife by herself in a foreign country. But apart from that, I am able to legally work in America!</p>"
